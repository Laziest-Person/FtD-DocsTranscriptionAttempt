Misc Functions

```
I:GetTerrainAltitude For Position(x,y,z)
Inputs:
x: [float] game world east west position in meters.
y: [float] game world vertical (not important)
z: game world north south position in meters.
Outputs: [float] the terrain altitude in meters where 0 is sea level.
Returns altitude of the terrain at a position in the world. Can be overloaded with a single Vector3 rather than x,y,z components.```

```
I:GetTerrainAltitudeForLocalPosition(x,y,z)
Inputs: 
x: [float] right offset from construct position in meters.
y: [float] up offset from construct position in meters
z: forwards offset from construct position in meters.
Outputs: [float] the terrain altitude in meters where 0 is sea level.
Returns altitude of the terrain at a position relative to the construct. Can be overloaded with a single Vector3 rather than x,y,z components.```

```I:GetGravityForAltitude(alt)
Inputs: alt: [float] altitude (0 is sea level)
Outputs: [Vector3] gravity vector
Returns gravity vector for an altitude. gravity.y is the component of interest.```

```
I:GetTime()
Inputs: N/A
Outputs: [float] the time in seconds.
Returns time with an arbitrary offset (i.e. the time will seldom be 0).```

```I:GetTimeSinceSpawn()
Inputs: N/A
Outputs: [float] the time in seconds since the construct spawned.
Returns time since construct spawned in seconds.```

```
I:GetGame Time()
Inputs: N/A
Outputs: [float] The time since the Instance started in seconds. 
Returns time since the instance started in seconds..```

```
I:GetWindDirectionAndMagnitude()
Inputs: N/A
Outputs: [Vector3] Vector representing the direction and the magnitude of the wind.
Get the direction and magnitude of the current wind.```
