Dediblade Spinners
(obsolete?)

Dedicated helicopter spinners have their own interface because they have their own indexing system

```
I:GetDediblade Count()
Inputs: N/A
Outputs: [int] the number of dedicated helicopter spinners
Returns the number of dedicated helicopter spinners```

```
I:GetDedibladeInfo(DedibladeIndex)
Inputs:
DedibladeIndex:[int] 0 is the first dedicated helicopter spinner
Outputs: [BlockInfo] a block info object for the dedicated helicopter spinner. Returns block info for the dedicated helicopter spinner.```

```
I:IsDedibladeOnHull(DedibladeIndex)
Inputs:
DedibladeIndex:[int] 0 is the first dedicated helicopter spinner
Outputs: [bool] true if on hull
Returns whether the dedicated helicopter spinner is on the hull or on a SubConstruct.```

```
I:SetDedibladeSpeedFactor(DedibladeIndex, speedFactor)
Inputs:
DedibladeIndex:[int] 0 is the first dedicated helicopter spinner.
speedFactor:[float] 0 to 1, the fractional power output
Outputs: N/A
Set the speed factor. In continuous mode spinners this allows some blades to spin slower than others, in insta-spin blades this is related to the speed they are spinning at (1 is max speed, 0 is no speed), and in rotation spinners this does nothing.```

```
I:SetDedibladePowerDrive(DedibladeIndex, drive)
Inputs: 
DedibladeIndex:[int] 0 is the first dedicated helicopter spinner.
drive:[float] the relative power use of the dedicated helicopter spinner (0 to 10).
Outputs: N/A
Sets the power drive. this allows heliblades to produce more force. Requires engine power. O removes engine use. 10 is maximum power ```

```
I:SetDedibladeContinuousSpeed(DedibladeIndex, speed)
Inputs: 
DedibladeIndex:[int] 0 is the first dedicated helicopter spinner.
speed:[float] speed to rotate at. 30 is the maximum so values from -30 to 30 work.
Outputs: N/A
Sets the speed of rotation. Changes the dedicated helicopter spinner into continuous mode. 'ContinuouseReverse' mode is not available through this interface so set the speed negative to facilitate reverse spinning.```

```
I:SetDedibladeInstaSpin(DedibladeIndex,magnitudeAndDirection)
Inputs:
DedibladeIndex:[int] 0 is the first dedicated helicopter spinner.
magnitudeAndDirection:[float] -1 means spin backwards full speed, 1 is spin forwards full speed
Outputs: N/A
Spins the blades in a direction and speed determined by magnitudeAndDirection. Will set the dedicated helicopter spinner into instaspin forwards mode and will affect speed factor variable of the spinner.```

```
I:SetDediblade UpFraction(DedibladeIndex,upFraction)
Inputs: 
DedibladeIndex:[int] 0 is the first dedicated helicopter spinner.
upFraction:[float] 0 to 1.
Outputs: N/A
Sets the fraction of the force that will be applied directly upwards, regardless of blade orientation.```
