Spinners
(obsolete?)

Spin blocks spinners have their own interface because they use 'SubConstruct' identifiers 

```
I:SetSpinBlockSpeedFactor(SubConstructIdentifier,speedFactor)
Inputs: 
SubConstructIdentifier:[int] the persistent identifier of the SubConstruct.
speedFactor:[float] 0 to 1, the fractional power output
Outputs: N/A
Set the speed factor. In continuous mode spinners this allows some blades to spin slower than others, in insta-spin blades this is related to the speed they are spinning at (1 is max speed, 0 is no speed), and in rotation spinners this does nothing.```

```
I:SetSpinBlockPowerDrive(SubConstructIdentifier,drive)
Inputs: 
SubConstructIdentifier:[int] the persistent identifier of the SubConstruct.
drive:[float] the relative power use of the spinner (0 to 10).
Outputs: N/A
Sets the power drive, this allows heliblades to produce more force. Requires engine power. O removes engine use. 10 is maximum power```

```
I:SetSpinBlockRotationAngle(SubConstructIdentifier, angle)
Inputs:
SubConstructIdentifier:[int] the persistent identifier of the SubConstruct.
angle: [float] angle in degrees to turn to.
Outputs: N/A
Sets the angle of rotation. Changes the spinner into Rotate mode. 'Rotatebackwards' is not available through this interface but you shouldn't```

```
I:SetSpinBlockContinuousSpeed(SubConstructIdentifier, speed)
Inputs:
SubConstructIdentifier:[int] the persistent identifier of the SubConstruct.
speed:[float] speed to rotate at. 30 is the maximum so values from -30 to 30 work.
Outputs:N/A
Sets the speed of rotation. Changes the spinner into continuous mode. 'ContinuouseReverse' mode is not available through this interface so set the speed negative to facilitate reverse spinning.```

```
I:SetSpinBlockInstaSpin(SubConstructIdentifier,magnitudeAndDirection)
Inputs:
SubConstructidentifier:[int] the persistent identifier of the SubConstruct.
magnitudeAndDirection:[float] -1 means spin backwards full speed, 1 is spin forwards full speed
Outputs: N/A
Spins the blades in a direction and speed determined by magnitudeAndDirection. Will set the spinner into instaspin forwards mode and will affect speed factor variable of the spinner.```
