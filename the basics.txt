The Basics

The basic code file needs a function called Update that takes an input called I. It should look like this-

```function Update(I)
-- put your code here
end```

I is the interface to the game and contains all the function calls you see on these help pages.
The code in Update will be executed every single physics step (the game runs at 40 physics steps per in game second of time)

```
-- creates a comment line so the line '-- put your code here' is never executed by the game. Comments are for explaining how your code functions. Here is a simple example of a function that uses one of the interface functions to write 'Hello' to the HUD
function Update(I)
I:Log('Hello')
end```
